# Session 1, Set 1, Problem 1: Counting Treasure
# Captain Blackbeard has a treasure map with several clues that point to different locations on an island. 
# Each clue is associated with a specific location and the number of treasures buried there. Given a dictionary 
# treasure_map where keys are location names and values are integers representing the number of treasures buried 
# at those locations, write a function total_treasures() that returns the total number of treasures buried on the island.

treasure_map1 = {
    "Cove": 3,
    "Beach": 7,
    "Forest": 5
}

treasure_map2 = {
    "Shipwreck": 10,
    "Cave": 20,
    "Lagoon": 15,
    "Island Peak": 5
}

print(SolutionTwo.total_treasures(treasure_map1)) 
print(SolutionTwo.total_treasures(treasure_map2))

# Output:
# 15
# 50
